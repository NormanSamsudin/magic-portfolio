## Overview

Developed a comprehensive API integration system for major logistics providers in Malaysia including City-Link and J&T. This backend solution enables users to compare shipping fees across different carriers and optimize their shipping costs by selecting the most economical delivery options.

## Key Achievements

- **Multi-Carrier Integration**: Successfully integrated APIs from multiple major logistics providers
- **Cost Optimization**: Enabled significant shipping cost savings through price comparison
- **Real-Time Rates**: Implemented real-time shipping rate calculation and comparison
- **Scalable Architecture**: Built system capable of adding new logistics providers easily

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: Backend server development and API orchestration
- **Express.js**: Web framework for robust API development
- **MongoDB**: Database for storing shipping data, rates, and transaction logs
- **RESTful APIs**: Integration with multiple logistics provider APIs
- **JWT Authentication**: Secure API access and user authentication
- **Redis**: Caching for improved performance and rate limiting

## Logistics Providers Integrated

**City-Link Express**:

- Real-time rate calculation for domestic and international shipping
- Tracking integration for shipment status updates
- Pickup scheduling and delivery confirmation services
- Special handling options for fragile and valuable items

**J&T Express**:

- Comprehensive rate calculation covering all service tiers
- Cash-on-delivery (COD) service integration
- Bulk shipping rate calculations for business customers
- Real-time tracking and delivery notifications

**Additional Providers**:

- Pos Malaysia integration for government postal services
- DHL integration for premium international shipping
- FedEx integration for express delivery services
- Framework ready for additional logistics providers

## Core Functionality

**Rate Comparison Engine**:

- Real-time rate fetching from multiple providers simultaneously
- Intelligent comparison algorithm considering price, delivery time, and service quality
- Dynamic pricing updates based on distance, weight, and package dimensions
- Special rate calculations for bulk shipments and business accounts

**Shipping Calculator API**:

- RESTful endpoints for rate calculation requests
- Support for various package types (documents, parcels, freight)
- Weight and dimension validation with carrier-specific limits
- Service type selection (standard, express, overnight delivery)

**Tracking Integration**:

- Unified tracking interface across all integrated carriers
- Real-time status updates and delivery notifications
- Historical tracking data storage and analytics
- Automated customer notification system for status changes

## API Architecture

**Microservices Design**: Modular architecture with separate services for each logistics provider, enabling independent scaling and maintenance.

**Rate Aggregation Service**: Centralized service that coordinates rate requests across multiple providers and returns consolidated results.

**Data Normalization**: Standardized data format across different provider APIs for consistent user experience.

**Error Handling**: Robust error handling with fallback mechanisms when providers are unavailable.

## Performance Optimization

**Caching Strategy**:

- Redis caching for frequently requested routes and rates
- Intelligent cache invalidation based on rate validity periods
- Geolocation caching for faster distance calculations
- Provider API response caching to reduce external API calls

**Concurrent Processing**:

- Parallel API calls to multiple providers for faster response times
- Asynchronous processing for non-critical operations
- Request queuing for high-traffic scenarios
- Connection pooling for database operations

**Rate Limiting**:

- API rate limiting to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage
- Provider-specific rate limiting to comply with their API restrictions
- Dynamic throttling based on provider response times
- Priority queuing for premium users

## Cost Savings Features

**Smart Comparison Algorithm**:

- Multi-factor comparison including price, delivery time, and reliability
- Historical performance data integration for provider selection
- Seasonal rate analysis and recommendations
- Bulk shipping discount calculations

**Cost Analytics**:

- Historical shipping cost analysis and reporting
- Savings tracking and ROI calculations
- Predictive cost modeling for budget planning
- Cost breakdown analysis by route and provider

**Optimization Recommendations**:

- Automated recommendations for cost-effective shipping options
- Bulk shipping suggestions for regular customers
- Route optimization for multiple deliveries
- Alternative provider suggestions during peak seasons

## Integration Benefits

**For E-commerce Businesses**:

- Reduced shipping costs through competitive rate comparison
